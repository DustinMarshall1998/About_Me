🚀 About Me
Hi, I’m Dustin — a self-taught developer with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. I work across a wide range of projects including:

🐍 Python & ☕ Java development

🧠 AI & automation

🌐 Web & app development

🍓 Raspberry Pi & Flipper Zero hacking

🔒 Cybersecurity & OS tinkering

I’m currently at an intermediate skill level, constantly pushing myself further by learning through hands-on building and deep YouTube dives.

📌 What I’m Doing Here
📁 Building a portfolio of real, useful tools and systems

🤝 Contributing to open-source projects I believe in

🧪 Experimenting with code to break, fix, and understand how it all works

💡 Motto
“Learn by breaking. Master by rebuilding.”

Feel free to fork, open issues, or reach out if you see something cool or want to collaborate.

Let me know if you want a more casual or more professional tone, or if you’d like to include contact links, portfolio sites, or specific pinned repos.
