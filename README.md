👋 Hey there, I’m Dustin Marshall
I’m a self-taught developer and builder with a strong passion for learning by doing. I specialize in creating hands-on, real-world projects that span across a wide range of tech fields. My learning journey is driven by curiosity and fueled by countless hours of YouTube tutorials, community projects, and trial-and-error experimentation.

🧠 My Core Skills & Focus Areas
💻 Programming Languages:
Python, Java, JavaScript, Bash, HTML/CSS

📦 Project Domains:

🔧 Raspberry Pi development – from automation to custom OS tools

🛠️ Flipper Zero development – exploring hardware hacking & security

🌐 Web development – building UIs, full-stack apps, and custom tools

🤖 AI & ML experiments – integrating models into practical apps

🔐 Cybersecurity projects – network tools, scanning, and defense testing

⚙️ Automation & scripting – streamlining systems & data pipelines

📱 App development – cross-platform tools and experimental UIs

🖥️ OS development & customization – building lightweight and modular OS experiences
